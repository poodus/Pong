Pong - a Ping utility for the 21st Century.
==============

We built a flexible ping utility, which is be command-line executable
on both Mac and Linux. Ping uses ICMP Echo Requests to test round trip 
packet time and to detect packet loss across networks.

Developed as a NDSU Capstone Project -- Spring 2013 -- Dr. Dean Knudson.
Created with specs from Ericsson of Sweden.
